BookBot is my first [Boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev) project!


# BookBot: Text Analysis Project

BookBot is a simple command-line tool written in Python to analyze the contents of a text file. It provides a quick statistical report, including the total word count and a detailed breakdown of character frequency.

This project was built as part of the [Boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev) curriculum.

## Features

* **Word Count**: Reports the total number of words in the provided text file.
* **Character Frequency**: Provides a sorted list of every character found and how many times it appeared.
* **Simple CLI**: Easy to run from any terminal.
